Top Ward in Need:
The Top Ten Ward in Need chart ranks Torontoâ€™s wards based on a composite housing need score that combines three key indicators: median income, percentage of low-income residents, and number of renters. Ward 13 (Toronto Centre) tops the list with a perfect score of 100, reflecting extremely high vulnerability due to a large renter population, low household income, and a high share of residents living in poverty. Other high-need wards include Ward 10, Ward 5, and Ward 7. This ranking makes it clear where the city should prioritize its affordable housing investments. It offers a data-driven approach to equity-focused planning.
