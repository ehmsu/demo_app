Number of Renters:
 This chart shows the number of renters by ward and reveals that Ward 13 (Toronto Centre) once again stands out with nearly 50,000 renters, more than double the cityâ€™s median. Other wards such as Ward 10 and Ward 11 also have substantial renter populations. Since renters tend to be more vulnerable to rent increases and displacement, this chart reinforces the case for focusing affordable housing efforts in renter-dense wards. It also suggests that policies protecting tenants and ensuring long-term affordability should be concentrated where rental housing is the dominant tenure type.
