Summary of RGI Housing:
1970-1990: There was a peak in the development of Rent-Geared-to-Income (RGI) units, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of total housing. Post-1990 Decline: After 1990, there was a sharp decline in both the number and proportion of RGI units, with the drop becoming especially pronounced after 2010.Decreasing Share: The percentage of RGI units has notably decreased in recent decades, indicating a shift away from deeply affordable housing development. Policy Implications: The data suggests a change in policy or funding priorities after 1990, as fewer RGI units were built despite ongoing overall housing growth. Equity Concerns: This trend raises concerns about housing affordability and equity, particularly for low-income households.
