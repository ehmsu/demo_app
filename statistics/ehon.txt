Expanding Housing Options in Neighborhoods:
This chart highlights how many new homes could be built in each ward under the cityâ€™s Expanding Housing. Options in Neighborhoods (EHON) initiative, which projects housing growth potential through 2051. Some wards, such as Ward 14 and Ward 10, show strong development potential with over 12,000 units each.  Importantly, Ward 13 and Ward 11 also have both high EHON potential and high housing need making them excellent candidates for prioritized development. However, vulnerable wards like Ward 16 and Ward 22 have low EHON potential, likely due to restrictive zoning or limited land availability. This reveals a challenge: some of the areas that need housing most are not well-positioned to grow under current policies.
