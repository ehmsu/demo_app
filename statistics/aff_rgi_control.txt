Approved Housing Units by Ward (Affordable, RGI, and Rent-Controlled): â€‹
This chart breaks down the number of approved housing units across each ward by type: affordable homes, rent geared to income (RGI) homes, and rent controlled market units. We can see that Ward 6 stands out with the highest number of affordable homes approved, followed by Wards 10, 13, and 17. Rent controlled units are more evenly distributed, with noticeable activity in Wards 4, 16, and 21. However, RGI homes, which are the most deeply subsidized, remain consistently low across most wards. This may point to an ongoing need for more deeply affordable housing options.
